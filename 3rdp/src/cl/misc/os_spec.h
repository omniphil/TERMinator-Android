/* Various compilers handle includes in subdirectories differently.  Most
   will work with paths from a root directory.  Non-OS X Macintoshes don't
   recognise '/'s as path delimiters, but work around it by scanning all
   subdirectories and treating the files as if they were in the same
   directory (INC_ALL).  Microsoft C, in a braindamaged exception to all
   other compilers, treats the subdirectory as the root, unless explicitly
   told to use the project-file directory by setting Project | Settings |
   C/C++ | Preprocessor | Additional include directories to '.\'.  The
   Tandem NSK (Guardian) filesystem doesn't have subdirectories, and the C
   compiler zaps '.'s, truncates filenames to 7 characters, and appends a
   'h' to the name (so that asn1misc.h becomes asn1mish).  This
   unfortunately requires a bit of renaming for header files.  Tandem OSS
   (Unix services) on the other hand is just like Unix, so we explicitly
   distinguish between the two */

/* Enable optional newer Posix features if they're available.  This is a 
   majorly problematic define to use because although it gives us access to
   newer capabilities that may not be present by default, compiler vendors
   really, really want to use it to show off how clever they are as rules
   lawyers, so that _POSIX_C_SOURCE gives them free reign to abort the 
   compile if you don't navigate the maze of often compiler-specific options
   and defines needed to comply with the requirements of fifteen different
   standards documents, as interpreted by the compiler vendor.  For example
   SunPro C's sys/feature_tests.h performs a complex series of checks to 
   enforce rules such as "if you define this but don't define that and also 
   define the other and it's the second Tuesday of the month, stop with a 
   #error rather than continuing".  In theory we can get past the SunPro 
   checks by defining the Sun-specific _STDC_C99 and _XPG6, but this still 
   produces internal errors in headers due to various things being enabled 
   or not enabled by various defines.

   As a result, we use a whitelist approach and only define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 
   if there's a reasonable chance of the compile being able to continue.  
   For IBM compilers this means restricting ourselves to Posix 2001, for gcc
   we can at least use Posix 2008, but then defining it has the braindamaged 
   effect of disabling the use of all BSD-specific defines and data types, 
   which the networking headers are riddled with.  In order to deal with 
   this additionally define _BSD_SOURCE to re-enable all the defines and 
   types that _POSIX_C_SOURCE takes away.  However, in a further bit of
   braindamage, glibc went from _BSD_SOURCE in 2.19 to _DEFAULT_SOURCE in
   2.20, and the headers complain if they see _BSD_SOURCE defined.  Since
   there's no way to tell whether glibc wants to see _BSD_SOURCE or
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE, we take advantage of the fact that defining 
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE takes precedence over _BSD_SOURCE, so the warnings go
   away.
   
   The value that we can define for _POSIX_C_SOURCE also varies from OS to
   OS, in theory n-1 is a subset of n but some OSes will only accept n while
   others want to see n-1 */

/* The Palm OS SDK compiler tries to make enums as small as possible (8-bit
   unsigned chars if it can, otherwise 16-bit unsigned shorts, otherwise
   ints) for backwards-compatibility with the old 68K-based Palm interface,
   which causes severe problems for code that assumes that enum == int.  
   CodeWarrior allows this enum behaviour to be turned off, but pacc 
   doesn't.

   Similarly, the MSDOS-derived (!!) Watcom C compiler used with older
   versions of QNX 4.x uses 16-bit enums (DOS 16-bit ints) if possible, and
   again there's no way to disable this behaviour (there is with newer
   versions, the pragma to fix the problem is used further down).

   Some Arm SDKs, based on similarly antique ideas about enums, force the 
   use of variable-sized enums even though it causes little difference in 
   memory usage and slows down each enum access due to unaligned-data 
   issues.  This braindamage is permitted by the ARM AAPCS (section 7.1.3), 
   which says that "this ABI delegates a choice of representation of 
   enumerated types to a platform ABI", followed by a long discussion of all 
   the problems that this causes, after which it's allowed anyway.  
   Fortunately it's fixed in AArch64, with the "Procedure Call Standard for 
   the Arm 64-bit Architecture" specifying that enum's must be at least 32 
   bits.

   Finally, it can also be optionally enabled for compilers like gcc via 
   -fshort-enums, which is what Telit does for its builds.

   cryptlib is written to be variable-size-enum safe, but since this isn't
   so easy to test because of the obscurity of the platforms that do this

/* Useful data types.  Newer compilers provide a 'bool' datatype via 
   stdbool.h, but in a fit of braindamage generally make this a char instead 
   of an int.  While Microsoft's use of char for BOOLEAN in the early 1980s 
   with 8/16-bit 8086s and 128K of RAM makes sense, it's a pretty stupid 
   choice for 32- or 64-bit CPUs because alignment issues mean that it'll 
   generally still require 32 or 64 bits of storage (except for special 
   cases like an array of bool), but then the difficulty or even inability 
   of many CPUs and/or architectures to perform byte-level accesses means 
   that in order to update a boolean the system has to fetch a full machine 
   word, mask out the byte data, or/and in the value, and write the word 
   back out.  So 'bool' = 'char' combines most of the worst features of both 
   char and int.
   
   It also leads to really hard-to-find implementation bugs due to the fact 
   that '(bool) int = true' produces different results to 
   '*(bool *) intptr = true', something that was resolved years ago in enums 
   without causing such breakage.  
   
   Quite apart from those issues, the fact that we use fault-immune values
   for booleans (see misc/safety.h) means that we can't use a bool because 
   it's only defined for the values 0 and 1, a single fault away from each 
   other.

		status = bar();
	if( cryptStatusOK( status ) )
		status = baz();
	if( cryptStatusOK( status ) )
		...

   These can be made more efficient when the compiler can assume that the
   majority case has 'status == CRYPT_OK'.  Some compilers provide a means 
   of doing this via __builtin_expect().  As usual for the gcc version the 
   documentation for this is quite confusing, taking advantage of decades
   of psychological research which shows that statements given as negatives
   are the hardest type of statement for humans to process:

     "if( __builtin_expect( x, 0 ) ) foo (); would indicate that we do not 
	 expect to call foo, since we expect x to be zero"

   In this case the test is actually the expression 'x', which is evaluated
   as 'x != 0', with the second parameter only taking values 0 (to mean 'not
   likely') or 1 (to mean 'likely').  So the appropriate usage is 
   "__builtin_expect( expr, 0 )" to mean that we don't expect something and 
   "__builtin_expect( expr, 1 )" to mean that we do expect it.  This leads
   to definitions of the form:

	#define cryptStatusError( status ) \
			__builtin_expect( ( status ) < CRYPT_OK, 0 )
	#define cryptStatusOK( status ) \
			__builtin_expect( ( status ) == CRYPT_OK, 1 )

   which assume that in the majority of situations we won't encounter the 
   error case.
   
   However the highly confusing way that __builtin_expect() works and the 
   fact that the stereotyped form from Linux is as likely()/unlikely()
   macros means that we use those macros instead of an explicit 
   __builtin_expect() expression, since they're the most likely to be 
   recognised and correctly handled by different compilers */

/* In some cases we only need to deal with a subset of CPUs that require,
   or at least perform poorly without, aligned accesses, in which case we
   need to tell the compiler that when such a CPU is being used it needs
   to align data items.  There are two types of data items that need to
   be aligned in this manner, fields in a structure and data blocks on the
   stack.  
   
   For the former this occurs in the kernel storage block, which contains 
   object-specific storage within a larger kernel-storage structure, with
   alignment requirements for the object-specific storage.

   For the latter this occurs in two cases, firstly where we're adding 
   cookies to buffers on architectures that fault on unaligned accesses if 
   the fault handler doesn't fix up the access.  In most cases these buffers 
   are aligned anyway due to the additional data surrounding them, the code 
   doesn't depend on it.

   Secondly, where we're working with hardware crypto intrinsics that depend 
   on a particular alignment for key and/or input/output data.  This 
   currently only occurs with VIA CPUs, which require 16-byte alignment for 
   AES crypto, however some older Intel AES-NI implementations also require 
   16-byte alignment.
   
   Currently ALIGN_STACK_DATA is always the same as ALIGN_STRUCT_FIELD, but 
   we use distinct defines in case there's a need to tune it for different 
   situations.  In particular, it relies on a bare 
   '__attribute__(( aligned ))' being "maximum useful alignment for a scalar 
   data type / the target machine", which is typically 16 bytes for a 64-bit
